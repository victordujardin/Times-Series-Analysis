# Analyzing Daily Stock Returns of Dell Computer Corporation: Project Time Series

## Description

This project is an in-depth analysis of the daily stock returns of Dell Computer Corporation. Using time series analysis and statistical modeling techniques, we aim to understand the behavior of Dell's stock returns, predict future trends, and identify potential investment opportunities.

The report delves into data exploration, transformations to achieve stationarity, and the application of Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) analyses. Advanced time series models, such as ARMA and GARCH, have been fitted to the data. The study culminates with predictions based on the constructed models.
