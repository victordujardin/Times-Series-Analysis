## Description

This project conducts an in-depth analysis of the daily stock returns of Dell Computer Corporation. It aims to apply time series analysis and statistical modeling techniques to understand stock return behavior, predict future trends, and explore potential investment strategies.

Key components of the analysis include:
- Data exploration and preprocessing.
- Stationarity testing and data transformation.
- Autocorrelation analysis using ACF and PACF.
- Model fitting with ARMA and GARCH models.
- Stock return predictions.

## Installation

To run this analysis, you will need R and RStudio. The analysis also depends on several R packages, which can be installed using the following command:

```R
install.packages(c("forecast", "tseries", "rugarch", "ggplot2", "PerformanceAnalytics"))
```

## Data

The dataset comprises the daily stock return data for Dell Computer Corporation. The R Markdown document contains detailed instructions on data access and preprocessing.

## Usage

To execute the analysis:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the R Markdown file in RStudio.
3. Install the required R packages.
4. Knit the document to produce the analysis report.

## Methodology

The project utilizes a structured approach to model the time series data of stock returns:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and transform data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and summarize data features.
3. **Stationarity and Differencing**: Test and ensure data stationarity for time series modeling.
4. **Model Selection and Fitting**: Identify appropriate time series models and fit them to the data.
5. **Model Diagnostics**: Evaluate model fit and performance.
6. **Prediction**: Forecast future stock returns using the models.

## Results

The analysis report includes:

- Visualizations of data and model fits.
- Statistical analysis of model performance.
- Predictions of future stock returns, complete with confidence intervals.
